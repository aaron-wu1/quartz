Key question is how do we make HTTP requests stateful?\n\nWe can add user field to requests to represent which user is interacting with API\n**POST /login**\n{ user: \"bob\", pass: \"lol\"}\n\nNow how the problem arises of how can we differentiate between requests from bad actors that claim that they are {user: \"bob\"} \n### Identifying State\nSession Token are hashed strings used to identify who is interacting with the server. The tokens are generated on login and stored server side on a key value table of users : session token. \n\nExample:\n\nUser      |  Session\n---- | ----\nBob       |   xifsop9\nAlice       |   few8nce\nBob       |   ewijpw0\n\n## Storing Sessions\nNow that we have session tokens generated, we need to figure out how can we store them on the client.\n\nTwo types: **Cookie Based** or **Local Storage**\n##### Cookie Based\nSecurity Flaws:\n- [XSS]\n- [CSRF]\n\n##### Local Storage\nNeed users to make deliberate requests\n\n\n## Architectural Considerations\nSession tokens **require** a DB hit.\nConcerns:\n- DoS attack\n- DB scale\n\n**Typically the solution is to decentralize**\n\n![[Screenshot 2023-12-27 at 1.23.43 PM.png]]\nan idea is to use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)\n## JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)\nJWTs are structured as {header, payload, signature} where:\n- header -\u003e algorithm  + type of token (JWT)\n- payload -\u003e app data (user data)\n- signature -\u003e algorithm(header + data, secret)\nThe signature is use the algorithm to verify the data.\n\n![[Screenshot 2023-12-27 at 1.29.48 PM.png]]\nConsiderations:\n- Uses JWT to verify identity, doesn't have a central state of truth as with the sessions table.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-28T20:58:44.57825838Z","tags":[]},"/notes/first-2brain-note":{"title":"first 2brain note","content":"\nHello world! \n\npretty basic huh ?\n\nxD\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-28T20:58:44.57825838Z","tags":[]},"/notes/second-2brain-note-lol":{"title":"second 2brain note lol","content":"\ntesting hot reload for dev","lastmodified":"2023-12-28T20:58:44.57825838Z","tags":[]},"/notes/third-2-brain-note-lol":{"title":"third 2 brain note lol","content":"\n:P","lastmodified":"2023-12-28T20:58:44.57825838Z","tags":[]},"/summary/Atomic-Habits":{"title":"Atomic Habits","content":"From Atomic Habits by James Clear\n## **3 Key Lessons**\n- Small habits\n- Focus on system rather than goals\n- Identity-based habits\n\n## **4 Steps to build better habits**\n1.

Craving: make it unattractive\n3. Response: make it difficult\n4. Reward: make it unsatisfying\n\n## ** How to create a good habit**\n### **1. Cue: Make it obvious**\n- Write down current habits to become aware of them.\n- Use implementation intentions: \"I will [Behavior] at [Time] in [Location]\"\n- Use habit stacking: \"After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit]\"\n- Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible\n\n## 2. Craving: Make it attractive\n- Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\n- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior\n- Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit\n\n## 3. Response: Make it easy\n- Decrease # of steps to start good habit\n- Prepare environment to make habit easier\n- Optimize the small choices needed to make the habit happen\n- Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.\n- Automate your habits\n\n## 4. Reward: Make it satisfying\n- Use reinforcement. immediate reward when completing a habit\n- Make \"doing nothing\" enjoyable.\n- Use a habit tracker\n- Never miss twice\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-28T20:58:44.57825838Z","tags":[]},"/tags/setup":{"title":"setup","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-12-28T20:58:44.57825838Z","tags":[]}}
