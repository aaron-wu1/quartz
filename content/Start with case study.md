When introducing a topic, start with a case study. 
- When explaining math formula/ complex topics, set the context and scene first and fill in the variables only when can't formulate into a verbal structure (too hard to conceptualize formula as a listener while reading).
	- speak to the listener's subconscious mind to build insight rather than try to match the listerner to your thoughts. (possibly?)
