### Metrics
- **First contentful paint**
	- measures the time it takes the browser to begin visibly rendering the webpage
	- normally measured though loading the largest visible element
- **Speed index**
	- measure of how fast the website's DOM gets rendered
	- shorter speed indices means the page will stablize faster
- **First CPU idle (first Interactive)**
	- measure the time until the page is capable of handling the majority of user inputs in a "reasonable" amount of time.
- **Time to Interactive**
	- measures the time until the user can meaningfully interact with the majority of the site with delays of under 50ms.
- **Max Potential First Input Delay**
	- measures the maximum possible delay a user can experience after they attempt to interact with an element on the page
