## What is this?

This is my virtual space that double as both a second brain and a place to learn in public!

I’ve found that some of the most valuable insights on the internet come from individuals sharing their experiences and knowledge through blogs. Inspired by them, I decided to create my own.

There are two goals of this space:

1. To share what I’ve learned in the hopes of helping others the same way I found help through online blogs
2. To put my knowledge out in public to be challenged and critiqued as a form of learning
