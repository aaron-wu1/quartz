### How Angular renders components?
For each component that is used in an Angular app, the Angular compiler generates a **factory**.

This factory is used to instantiate a View Definition to create component view. **Angular represents an application as a tree of views**

**Factory**
- consists of view nodes generated by the compiler as a result of template parsing.
- EX. Given template:	```
```HTML
		<span>I am {{name}}</span>
```
Generates the following component factory
```JS
function View_AComponent_0(l) {
	return jit_viewDef1(0, 
		[
			jit_elementDef2(0,null,null,1,'span',...),
			jit_textDef3(null,['I am ',...]) ],
			null,
			function(_ck,_v) {
			var _co = _v.component;
			var currVal_0 = _co.name;
			_ck(_v,1,0,currVal_0);
```
