### Definition
MVC - Model-View-Controller
A pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. 
**Key note:**
- **separation between the software's business logic and display**

### Structure
- **Model**: Manages data and business logic (think state + logic)
- **View**: Handles layout and display (think templates)
- **Controller**: Routes commands to model and view parts (think data binding sort of)
