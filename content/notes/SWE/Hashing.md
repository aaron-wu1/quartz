### Definition
Generating fixed-sized output from an input variable size using mathematical functions known as hash functions

### Purpose
Creates a data structure that can store and search for values in constant time, O(1)

### Components
- **Key**
- **Hash function**
- **Hash table**

### Collisions
- open addressing
	- all elements are stored in hash table
	- hash table must be bigger than # of keys
- separate chaining
	- in the hash table, values are stored as linked lists, called a chain
	- Each node in the chain contains information about the key and value
	- Searching finds the matching hash(key) and loops the chain for the matching key to get the value
	- expandable
