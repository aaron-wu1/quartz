### What is an index?
A data structure that you build and assign on top of table that summarizes the data with shortcuts

### Index Types
- **B-Tree index** (balanced tree):
	- most common
	- 
- **Hash index**:
	- used for equality queries on small # of columns
	- faster than B-tree but not efficient for range queries
- **[[Bitmap Index|Bitmap Index]]**
	- find specific rows of data in a table with large number of columns
	- Efficient for both equality and range queries
	- Not well-suited for large tables
- **LSM Trees index**:
	- #TODO
