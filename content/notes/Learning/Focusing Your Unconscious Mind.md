### Big Idea
Learning hard concepts using intuition.

### Core principles
- Generate as many insights as possible
	- insights are random thoughts to help understand a concept better
	- eg. steps or examples to illustrate the concept
- Treat learning like problem solving
- Care about what you are doing lol
- Understand small pieces at a time
- Forget memorization

### Method
1. Start with understanding the big picture
2. Pick a detail to learn
3. Understand it context, eg. related to other details
	- try to not go too deep into understanding all the smaller and smaller details
4. Understand it by itself, diving deeper into the details
	  - **Caring** to be motivated to understand the detail
	  - Understanding the **point**, invent the piece from scratch
		  - What is this piece about?
		  - What does it do?
		  - What does it accomplish/describe?
		  - Try to solve the problem yourself,  try to invent the piece for yourself
		  - If not problem, try to reverse-engineer the rule in examples
	- Make the problem important to your brain
5. Reinforce it (Try to invent it)
	- Invent, look at step 4: point
	- Practice, try to apply the concept whenever you can
		- view the problem from multiple angles
	- Explain the concept
		- "Write it in your own words"
		- Start from scratch and work your ways through the details
		- Forces you to look for a simple way of viewing the concept
	- Explore
		- ask yourself dumb questions
		- Examples: Goal gain random insights to get a deeper meaning
			- change one part of the concept 
			- change one part of the problem
			- See if some other solution applies
			- Try to relate some of your past knowledge to the concept
			- Question any intuitive assumptions you're making
			- Try to break the concept
			- Look at the concept from different angles
			- Talk to others and ask about experience/insights
			- Ask why
			- Think about the stuff that's already intuitive to you and apply it
6. Repeat 2-5 for other details
