### What is Intuition?
**Note:**
Brain has two sides
- slow side:
	- Effort, processing, reasoning, conscious thinking
- fast side
	- Intuition, feel-based thinking, patterns, unconscious thinking

**What information does intuition use?**
- past knowledge
- knowledge of the problem/situation

**Improve past knowledge -> build intuition**

### Usage
- Use intuition to break down structure/thoughts
- Use slow brain to add details/prove initial intuition
- **Note**: need to do something to turn intuition into concrete thoughts

### How to improve intuition
Steps:
- Read the problem
- Immediately read the solution
- Tie similar problems together
Goal:
- Create a mental mapping of problems with solutions
- Or problem components with solution components
Note:
- Write down problem components
- Match problem components with solution ideas
	- also add in thought provoking questions to why it makes sense
Reasoning:
- You will remember better if:
	- you **come up with** the solution yourself
	- you **spend time on** the problem
	- you **understand why** the associations work
