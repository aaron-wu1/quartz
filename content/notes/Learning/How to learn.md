Strong learning:
- growing strong brain connections is a physical process 

Your brain is in a small universe:
- a collection of systems stacked

Mental roots
- true knowledge comes from earned experiences
- apply knowledge

Don't ignore feedback
- increment on learned experiences

Stick with the learning process
- working on building consistent habits
