Parkinson’s Law is the idea that your work will expand to fill the time allotted for its completion.

### Strategies to over come Parkinson's Law:
- Plan work strategically, assessing length of tasks
- Set self imposed deadlines
- Timeboxing tasks
- pomodero techique for staying on task

#### For Project based:
1. Clearly outline your vision statement and drivers
	-  What this project’s value is (this is [the vision](https://www.atlassian.com/team-central/project-planning/mission-and-vision-statements))
	-  Why this project makes sense for your team and your organization (these are the drivers
2. Clarify roles and responsibilities (Using DACI framework)
	- **D = Driver.** The one person responsible for corralling stakeholders, collating all necessary information, and getting a decision made by the agreed date. This may or may not be the project’s full-time owner, depending on the decision.
	- **A = Approver.** The one person who makes the decision.
	- **C = Contributors.** They have knowledge or expertise that may influence the decision (i.e., they have a voice, but no vote).
	- **I = Informed.** They are informed of the final decision.
3. Understand what’s in and out of scope
	- Figure out what can be done in the timeframe
4. Identify your trade offs
	- Figure out the priorities of tasks
5. Set your timeline
	- identify milestones and deadlines that occur within the project
