### Sense of Self
- Generators - impact other people (believe they change the world)
- Projectors - reflect on what they see 

### Types of energy
- neural and caloric

### Building habits / unconscious mind
- things suck at first but once your mind builds the repetitiveness and automates, your brain works at a higher rate which makes deliberate stuff easier 
- example rucking
	- walking with weight for a long time
	- sucks at first but gets easier and can do all day

### Detaching from the mob mentality
- as a leader, your team could sway certain ways due to events and it's your job to bring them back to the base lines (generally countering the mob mentality)
	- eg. winning high - "that was great, we did xyz right. There are some abc that we need to debrief on to do better"
	- eg. losing slump - "That was tough. Didn't go the way we wanted it to go. We need to learn some lessons. Here are some things I could do better. What can we do better to make sure this doesn't happen again"
		- acknowledgement -> purpose -> taking ownership -> collaboration

### Modulate emotion/ego
- be a counterweight to highs, but don't shut it down. find a balance
